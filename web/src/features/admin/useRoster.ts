// The role-scoped roster from /api/roster. Enabled only once the admin is verified.
// Staff accounts (is_staff=true) are split out of `members` into `staffMembers` so
// every consumer of `data.members` automatically excludes them from counts, attendance,
// analytics, and check-in pickers — without needing per-component changes.
//
// **Hidden members are split off the same way.** Someone carrying an open-ended status mark
// (졸업 · 타교회 정착 · 한국 귀국 · 이주 …) is off the roster: not in a count, not in the
// 오늘 list, the 출석부, 새가족, 새가족 교육, 통계, 동산 pickers or the 키오스크. Doing it
// here rather than per-tab is what makes that true everywhere at once — a new screen that
// reads `data.members` is correct without knowing the rule exists.
//
// They are not thrown away: `hiddenMembers` backs the 멤버 탭's 숨긴 멤버 section (clear the
// mark or give it an end date and they come straight back), and the 학기 아카이브 rebuilds
// the full list on purpose, so a finished term's Excel still contains everyone who was
// actually there — see ArchiveSection.
//
// The split itself, separate from the query so tests can build roster data the same way the
// app does — a fixture that hand-wrote `hiddenMembers` would be testing itself, not the rule.

// land (offline, blocked websocket, backgrounded tab): never serve the cached roster
// without revalidating, poll while the tab is in the foreground, and refetch the moment
// the tab is focused or the network comes back.
